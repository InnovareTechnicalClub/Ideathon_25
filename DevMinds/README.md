# Project Title: WasteNot – Food Waste Management App
 
 ## Problem Statement
 
 Food waste is a global crisis—1.3 billion tons of food are wasted annually while millions go hungry. Restaurants, households, and food businesses often discard surplus food due to the absence of real-time donation networks or centralized systems to connect them with recipients.
 
 ## Solution Overview
 
 We propose **WasteNot**, a real-time food donation coordination platform (web and mobile app) that connects donors like restaurants, households, and businesses with NGOs and individuals in need.
 
 The platform allows:
 
 - Food listing and donation management
 - Location-based AI-powered matching
 - Seamless logistics coordination
 - Impact tracking for transparency and awareness
 
 Our aim is to reduce waste, feed the hungry, and promote sustainable practices in communities.
 
 ## Tech Stack
 
 - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web & Mobile UI)
 - **Backend**: Node.js / Python (Flask)
 - **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase
 - **AI/NLP**: OpenAI for matching logic (Optional: Freshness check)
 - **Hosting**: Render / Firebase Hosting / AWS
